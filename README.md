# JSON THE CAT

## Cat Breed Fetcher

This project is a simple command-line application that fetches information about cat breeds from the [Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/) and returns a brief description of the specified breed.

## Getting Started

To use this project, you will need to have Node.js installed on your system. Once you have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), you can clone this repository to your local machine and install the dependencies using `npm`.

```
git clone https://github.com/seangray-dev/json-the-cat.git
cd json-the-cat
npm install
```

## Usage

To fetch a description of a specific cat breed, you can use the `index.js` file and specify the breed name as a command-line argument. For example:

```
node index.js "Siberian"
```

This will fetch a brief description of the Siberian cat breed and display it in the terminal.

If you enter an invalid breed name, the program will display an error message.
